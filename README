Apache::ParseLog 
- Object-oriented Perl extension for parsing Apache log files


DESCRIPTION

Apache::ParseLog provides an easy way to parse the Apache log files, 
using an object-oriented constructs. The data obtained using this 
module are generic enough that it is flexible to use the data for 
your own applications, such as CGI, simple text-only report generater, 
feeding RDBMS, data for Perl/Tk-based GUI application, etc.


FEATURES

1   Easy and Portable Log-Parsing Methods

Because all the work (parsing logs, constructing regex, matching and 
assigning to variables, etc.) is done inside this module, you can easily 
create log reports (unless your logs need intense scrutiny). Read on this
manpage as well as the the section on EXAMPLES section to see how easy it 
is to create log reports with this module.

Also, this module does not require C compiler, and it can (should) run on 
any platforms supported by Perl.

2   Support for LogFormat/CustomLog

The Apache Web Server 1.3.x's new LogForamt/CustomLog feature (with 
mod_log_config) is supported.

The log format specified with Apache's LogFormat directive in the 
httpd.conf file will be parsed and the regular expressions will be 
created dynamically inside this module, so re-writing your existing code 
will be minimal when the log format is changed.

3   Reports on Unique Visitor Counts

Tranditionally, the hit count is calculated based on the number of files 
requested by visitors (the simplest is the the total number of lines of 
the log file calculated as the "total hit").

As such, the hit count obviously can be misleading in the sense of 
"how many visitors who actually visited to my site?", especially if the 
pages of your site contain many images (because each image is counted 
as one hit).

Apache::ParseLog provides the methods to obtain such traditional data, 
because those data also are very important for monitoring your web site's 
activities. However, this module also provides the methods to obtain
the unique visitor counts, i.e., the actual number of "people" (well, 
IP or hostname) who visited your site, by date, time, and date and time.

See the the section on LOG OBJECT METHODS for details about those methods.

4   Pre-Compiled Regex

The new pre-compiled regex feature introduced by Perl 5.005 is used (if 
you have the version installed on your machine).

For the pre-compiled regex and the new quote-like assignment operator (qr), 
see perlop(1) and perlre(1) manpages.


PREREQUISITES

You will need Perl 5.004 or later. To use the pre-compiled regex, you will
need 5.005 or later. 

Although this package names may suggest, the mod_perl as well as any other
Apache::* modules are not necessary. 


INSTALLATION

The same as any perl modules:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
	make test
	make install

The Makefile.PL script will check the version of your perl, and if it is
newer than 5.005, it rewrites the ParseLog.pm file for the 5.005-compatible
version. For some reasons, if you need to rewrite the ParseLog.pm back to
the distributed version (5.004-compatible), run the command (note the option)

	perl Makefile.PL -r

Running this will rewrite the ParseLog.pm to the 5.004 version. 


DOCUMENTATION

If you want to read the manpage before you install, you can use perldoc to
read the manpage from the ParseLog.pm file, like:

	perldoc -F ParseLog.pm


CURRENT VERSION

Current version is 1.01 (10/01/1998)
